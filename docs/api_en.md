# Shodo API

üöÄWelcome to Shodo API documentationüöÄ

## Command

You can use Shodo's API from shodo command.
For example, you can proofread Japanese in a Markdown file.

```bash
$ pip install shodo
$ shodo login
$ shodo lint README.md
```

For more details, refer [shodo command's README](https://github.com/zenproducts/shodo-python/).

## API root

Specify Organization slug and project name.

```
https://api.shodo.ink/@{organization}/{project}/
```

## Authorization

First, issue Bearer tokens in the "API integration" settings page of Shodo's project.

Specify the token on Authorization header.

```
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## Lint/Proofreading API

This is API to proofread Japanese texts.

API URLÔºö`https://api.shodo.ink/@{organization}/{project}/lint/`

POST a Japanese body to the proofreading API.
Up to 40,000 characters are allowed.

```json
{
  "body": "Ê†°Ê≠£„Åô„ÇãÊú¨Êñá"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "lint_id": "6d639e5f-8bfe-43d7-ac24-8bb6b97ba936",
  "monthly_amount": 1000000,
  "current_usage": 116049,
  "len_body": 8429,
  "len_used": 8112
}
```

Shodo runs proofreading asynchronously.
The `lint_id` is used to get results of proofreading.

For example, you can use httpie to call this API.

```bash
$ http -A bearer -a d8eb...3359 https://api.shodo.ink/@org/project/lint/ text="Ê†°Ê≠£„Åô„ÇãÊú¨Êñá"
```

### Counting and caching

Shodo counts only Japanese sentences in the submitted body as the number of characters used.
The number of characters will be less than the length of all submitted body.

Submitted sentences will be cached, so if the same sentence is submitted again,
Shodo won't count them as monthly usage.

Each response of the proofreading API has the following meaning.

* `lint_id`: ID to get the result of the proofreading.
* `monthly_amount`: Number of characters available in the API (per month).
* `current_usage`: Number of characters used this month.
* `len_body`: Length of Japanese sentences of the submitted body.
* `len_used`: Used number of character (subtracting the cache).

For example, if all the cache is used, `len_used` will be `0`.
The cache is valid for about 30 minutes, but the cache time is not guaranteed.
Please be assured that the cache of the text is managed in a way that it is not leaked or affected by other users.

## Result API

You can get results of proofreading.

API URLÔºö`https://api.shodo.ink/@{organization}/{project}/lint/{lint_id}/`

## Proofreading multiple sentences

Shodo's API allows you to submit multiple texts at once.
Instead of `body`, you can specify a list of body texts with the parameter `bulk_body`.

```json
{
  "bulk_body": ["Êú¨Êñá1", "Êú¨Êñá2"]
}
```

The `messages` param of the proofreading result will be the result of each body.
For example, if `bulk_body` contains two bodies, the `messages` will be a list of two elements.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    [
      {
        "after": "",
        "before": "„Åå",
        "from": {
          "ch": 0,
          "line": 3
        }
      }
    ],
    []
  ],
  "status": "done",
  "updated": 1658379913
}
```
